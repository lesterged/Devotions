>> - 1 Timothy 4:13
Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.


***Our Light and Guidance***
>> - Psalm 119:105
105 Your word is a lamp to my feet
    and a light to my path.
>> - Psalm 119:9
How can a young man keep his way pure?
    By guarding it according to your word

***Meditate on it***
>> - Joshua 1:8
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.

>> - Psalm 119:97
Oh how I love your law!
    It is my meditation all the day.

***Read it everyday***
>> - Deuteronomy 17:18, 19
18 “And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law, approved by[c] the Levitical priests. 19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them,

***We must study the word of God***
>> - Ezra 7:9, 10
9 For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. 10 For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel.

***Gives wisdom and must be put into action***
>> - Matthew 7:24-29
24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”
28 And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, 29 for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.

***Encouragement and Hope***

***Accept it***
>> - 1 Thessalonians 2:13
 And we also thank God constantly[d] for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men[e] but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.



>> - Matthew 4:4
But he answered, “It is written,
“‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
    but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.
